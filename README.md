# OperatingPlatforms


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a software company who had a game program up and running on Android, but wanted to make the game available on other platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job discussing the different operating systems and how they differed in programming approaches

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The technical writing piece I worked on helped shape my code and let me focus on results better than had I tried to work without it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I may have done a clearer job writing out the UML diagram to make it easier to read and understand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The Gaming Room themselves did not know what the best approach would be, in either OS or programming language. I had to approach from the angle of someone with extensive background knowledge and draw on it to make good recommendations. You always must take into account the exact needs, otherwise your design can go awry, and you can have time or budget overruns.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I came at this project from the angle of the developer, starting with the design document. In the future, I will do the same, possibly starting with a UML design and a flowchart. This gives me a shape for the code to come in.
